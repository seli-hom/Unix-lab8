Part I: Basic Git workflow
1. Create a git repository and add at least one colleague as collaborator
2. Each developer should clone the repository
3. Now, one developer at a time, will:
a) Create or edit an existing file. Make sure to add at least 10 lines of text.
b) Add the file to the local git repository, commit and push
$ git add filename
$ git commit -m “log message”
$ git push
c) Check online that your changes were uploaded successfully
d) Tell the rest of the team that your changes are up for them to retrieve ($ git pull)
e) Call the next member in the team to do steps (a) to (d)
