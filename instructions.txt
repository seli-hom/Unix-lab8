Part I: Basic Git workflow
1. Create a git repository and add at least one colleague as collaborator
2. Each developer should clone the repository
3. Now, one developer at a time, will:
a) Create or edit an existing file. Make sure to add at least 10 lines of text.
b) Add the file to the local git repository, commit and push
$ git add filename
$ git commit -m “log message”
$ git push
c) Check online that your changes were uploaded successfully
d) Tell the rest of the team that your changes are up for them to retrieve ($ git pull)
e) Call the next member in the team to do steps (a) to (d)


Part II: Dealing with conflicts
After all the team is able to sequentially write changes and retrieve other members’ changes, we’ll
simulate conflicts, when work is done in parallel. A conflict will occur whenever you try to push to
the remote repository, but your changes are based in an older version than what is currently online
